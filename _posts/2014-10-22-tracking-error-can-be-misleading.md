When selecting an ETF to augment your portfolio one will typically vet the prospective asset for several traits. Investment objectives, horizon, the ETF's assets, and its costs and fees are usually always part of the equation. However within this process is typically a keen focus on the fund's tracking error, and an all-too-often assumption that this is indicative of the fund's total performance relative to its benchmark. In lieu of placing so much focus on tracking error to ascertain if a fund will fulfill your investment objective, most would likely be better served being cognizant of a metric that has a more accurate impact on the bottom line: excess return.

###Understanding the difference: tracking error vs. excess return

Firstly, what precisely is tracking error? It's a common misconception that it is in reference to how well a fund performs relative to the index or industry it's tracking. Essentially, if the biotech industry is up X percent this year, my ETF shares tracking the industry should be up X percent as well net of fund fees and expenses. Unfortunately that's not what tracking error truly references. The semantics of tracking error in their truest sense apply to the standard deviation of daily differences in return relative to the net asset value of a fund and the index it's following. In essence this means a fund that is consistently 3 basis points behind its index, but does so everyday with no vagaries, would have zero tracking error on paper. However that flawless tracking doesn't feel so stellar in real life: as this would result in a negative 7.5% difference in total return on the year. Conversely, an ETF that routinely is 6 basis points higher than its index for a couple days, then 4 basis points lower the next few but finishes the year with an identical return to its index would possess significant tracking error despite fulfilling ostensibly what most investors are actually interested in: mimicking the total return of the index.
So, establishing that tracking error is more felicitously categorized as the consistency of an ETF's daily return relative to its index, what is excess return? Excess return is far easier to define and really at the crux of what most desire from their ETF investment: it displays the fund's NAV total return compared with that of its benchmark return over a defined period of time. For example: the utility sector went up 14% this year? If my ETF tracking it went up 15% and possesses an expense ratio of .4%, then this fund has yielded a 1.4% excess return.
Bear in mind that a fund's NAV total return includes fund expenses, so excess return begins at the point where the fund began beating the index sans the expense ratio. You'll notice in our example the aforementioned ETF gets credit for a 1.4% excess return as opposed to just a 1% because it also beat the index by its expense ratio, which is included in our figure.

The chart above is used to help elucidate the aforementioned information. In this hypothetical example a fund with superior tracking error is juxtaposed with a fund that would be described as having poor consistency in its tracking ability. As apparent, the real-world manifestation of this is quite different than one would typically expect. This is not intended to denigrate the metric of tracking error and utilizing it as part of your thesis for owning a particular ETF, but merely to help contextualize it as only part of the story, not the story, when evaluating fund performance and objectives.

###Tracking error or excess return: which is more pertinent to your investment objectives?

Having established that tracking error follows the consistency of a fund's return relative to its index and excess return is indicative of the fund's overall performance compared with that of its index over a defined period of time, which one should you be more concerned with? The answer to that largely hinges upon what your investment timeframe is and your objective for owning the ETF in the first place.
For most retail investors, total return is likely at the forefront of your investment objectives when making most any investment decision. If your horizon can be defined as longer term and rooted in fundamental conviction for the accretion over time of an asset class, sector, industry, or index, then excess return should likely be your metric of emphasis. However, if your timeframe is more limited in scope, is a trade predicated on technical analysis, or is event driven, then you may stand to benefit more from a fund with precision tracking with little deviation from its benchmark. An investment in an ETF that has its success tied to it following precisely what a benchmark does, both on the long and short side, with a duration of less than one year should certainly consider the fund's tracking error and perhaps place greater emphasis on it than excess return.
There is far more that goes into the proper vetting of an investment instrument than these two metrics alone. However the two are often confused, and misleadingly so, when investment decisions are made and investors should be privy to the semantics of both excess return and tracking error and the impact it will have on their portfolio.
